## Detailed Task Descriptions

1. **Database Implementation in SQLite3**
   - Created tables using SQL scripts.
   - Imported datasets into the tables.
   - Wrote and tested basic SQL queries to verify table relationships and data integrity.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Preparation**
   - Reviewed the dataset files (both raw and cleaned versions) provided in the zip.
   - Analyzed missing values, standardized numerical fields, and planned for encoding categorical variables.
   - Conducted initial descriptive statistics and explored potential data visualizations.

3. **Python Script Evaluation**
   -Connect & Query:
Connect to the SQLite database and load data (e.g., from the WDI table) into a Pandas DataFrame.

Inspect Data:
Use df.info(), df.describe(), and df.isnull().sum() to understand data types, summary statistics, and missing values.

Handle Missing Values:
Fill numeric columns with the mean and categorical columns with the mode.

Standardize Numeric Data:
Apply scikit-learn‚Äôs StandardScaler to normalize numeric columns.

Encode Categorical Variables:
Use Pandas‚Äô get_dummies() to convert categorical data into numerical format.

Visualize Data:
Generate histograms, correlation heatmaps, and boxplots to identify distributions and outliers.

Save Cleaned Data:
Export the cleaned DataFrame to CSV and optionally write it back to the SQLite database.

## Challenges & Roadblocks

- **Data Mapping:**  
  Aligning dataset columns with our designed ERD required several tweaks. Some columns were inconsistent between raw and cleaned versions.
  
- **File Format Issues:**  
  Handling multiple file formats (SQL, CSV, Python) necessitated extra steps for proper integration.
  
- **Time Management:**  
  Balancing between database setup and evaluating data cleaning strategies proved challenging, but the team managed to stay on track.

## Next Week‚Äôs Goals

- Finalize the data cleaning process using the Python scripts in VSCode.
- Perform in-depth descriptive statistical analysis and data visualization.
- Update the ERD and SQL schema if needed, based on insights from the cleaned data.
- Prepare for subsequent analysis tasks (time series analysis and forecasting).
